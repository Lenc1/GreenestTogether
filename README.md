# Every_Greenest_Together
 An Android app based on the theme of environmental protection developed by Flutter

On the server side of the classification task, I used the <waste-classification-model> project by KManthey et al.
https://github.com/manuelamc14/waste-classification-model

Out of personal interest and as a first-time practice project developed with Flutter
there are many shortcomings, so please correct them.
